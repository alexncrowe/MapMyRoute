# MapMyRoute
Maps your road trip with recommended stop over points. Perfect for military members with limited travel days. 

## Search locations
 Make sure to check your spelling when searching for your start and end locations. The locations are found using the [Nominatim API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim). If an error pops up please double check your spelling. Locations are only searched CONUS. 

## Find your route
The shortest route is found between end points. How many hours per day do you prefer to drive? This tool finds stop over points within 30 minutes of that time limit and prioritizes bigger cities. 

## Export to shapefile
This tool also allows you to export your route and stopping points as a shapefile so you can edit on your own.
